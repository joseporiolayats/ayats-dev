blurb:
  heading: Who am I?
  text: Data Scientist currently doing AI projects on Computer Vision, Recommender
    Systems, Natural Language Processing and general Machine Learning
    Operations, as well as model lifecycle management
intro:
  heading: What do I work with?
  text: I craft projects in Python, R and SQL. The main data libraries I use are
    PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas, Polars. I'm deploying locally and in
    the cloud on Azure, AWS, Google Cloud.
projects:
  - image: img/illustrations-technologies.png
    text: Through the combined use of different frameworks, I code a different
      variety of projects in order to deliver the most fitting model with a
      focus on accuracy and the use of the different metrics regularly used in
      machine learning projects.

    text: Today there is a need for full lifecycle management of the models used in
      production, so MLOps is the solution to that. By using some of the newest
      and most functional MLOps libraries I'm able to keep all the steps of the
      model lifecycle in check by doing an accurate planning, getting the right
      data, cleaning/augmenting/curating the data, training, finetuning,
      deploying and monitoring the model and its actual performance.
