      text: "Today there is a need for full lifecycle management of the models used in production, so MLOps is the solution to that. By using some of the newest and most functional MLOps libraries I'm able to keep all the steps of the model lifecycle in check by doing an accurate planning, getting the right data, cleaning/augmenting/curating the data, training, finetuning, deploying and monitoring the model and its actual performance."

    heading: My values
    text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
