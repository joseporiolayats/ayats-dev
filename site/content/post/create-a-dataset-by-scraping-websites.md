F﻿irst we'll create the cookiecutter directory structure.

I﻿'ve found this one to be nice, since it incorporates Poetry as a vm  and package manager, which is really useful.

F﻿irst be sure to have cookiecutter installed

```
pip install -U cookiecutter
```

T﻿hen copypaste this command in order to replicate the directory structure from [here](https://github.com/albertorios/cookiecutter-poetry-pypackage)
